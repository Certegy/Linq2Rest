# Linq2Rest [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Certegy/Linq2Rest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Certegy/Linq2Rest)

The repository was initially downloaded from [https://bitbucket.org/jjrdk/linq2rest/downloads](https://bitbucket.org/jjrdk/linq2rest/downloads). A bunch of stuff was removed, we made a few modifications, and finally pushed everything to GitHub.
